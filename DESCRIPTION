Description: This function offers several options for creating plots with
    SpatialPolygons objects. This can be a single plot or multiple plots. These
    multi-plots can have the same legend or individual legends. Additionally, the
    layout call within this function offers many options for improving the resulting
    figures. The third function, assessmaps, offers the ability to perform a secondary
    assessment on the random effects, such as those mapped via fillmap.
